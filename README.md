### Hi there 👋


**What's crackin'?** I'm currently taking ✨ _Python & C++_ ✨ classes (CS10 and CS110B). LMK what class you are taking.  Let's `drop in` and get that dub!

Here are little something 'bout me:

- 🔭 I’m not currently working on any project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to start undergrad CS research project
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI/Data academic research project
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding paid gigs
- 💬 Ask me about C++ but only basic questions
- 📫 How to reach me: @meiorz3 on twitter my DMs are open
- 😄 Pronouns: She/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: The longest word in the English language is “pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis”, which is a type of lung disease.
